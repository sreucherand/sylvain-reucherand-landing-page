You can almost smell it. Front-end wise, the bars are dynamically pre-rendered at runtime, from a single grayscale packaging texture and colours output by the CMS. A fragment shader applies the gradient map to the texture, which is then cut into several pieces to make the opening possible. The CMS has also been configured to pack assets into sprite sheets."
